# Non-parametric initialization method for K-means algorithm

Perform EL++. Return centers than can be used for initialization for K-means.

This algorithm uses the empirical likelihood approach on the set of normalized residuals, in order to obtain centers that make K-means coverge faster and obtain excellent clustering solutions.
